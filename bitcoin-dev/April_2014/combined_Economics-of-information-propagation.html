        <h3>Summary:</h3>
        <p>The Bitcoin-development mailing list has been active with discussions on various topics related to improving block propagation times, mining incentives, and the unit of account for small amounts. One suggestion is to use headers-first propagation to determine the primacy of a block based on the time the block header is received, which is faster and more efficient than the current system. However, there are concerns that this method would disadvantage small miners who earn no profit while waiting for the information to validate the block and update their UTXO sets.Other suggestions include distributing partial proofs of work and 'priming' memory pools with transactions, allowing peers to request the list of transaction hashes that make up a block, and using alternative units of account like "credits" or "ubits". There is also a discussion on the harmful effects of small miners mining on top of block headers without including any transactions or doing any validation, which could harm the security of Bitcoin.A post-graduate economist named Jonathan Levin wrote a paper on the incentives of mining and pointed out that the marginal cost for miners does not come from validating signatures and including them in blocks but rather the increased probability of orphaned blocks due to slower propagation. He also found that propagation delays result in increasing returns to higher shares of hashing power, leading to possible centralization incentives.The email conversation also discussed the need for a name for smaller units of Bitcoin, with suggestions like "ubit" and "credits," while cautioning against using "bit" due to cultural connotations. Additionally, there were discussions on headers-first propagation as a solution to block propagation delays, and how mining on top of just a block header could disadvantage small miners. Finally, the conversation touched upon the idea of improving block propagation times and the harmful effects of small miners mining on top of block headers without including any transactions or doing any validation, which could harm the security of Bitcoin.In an email chain from the Bitcoin-development mailing list, Jonathan Levin, a post-graduate economist, is writing a paper on the incentives of mining. He wants to calculate the change in the curvature of the probability mass function that a block hears about his block in any given second as a function of the block size. Levin believes that it is important to get a sense of the magnitude of the incentives at play and determine what implications this has for the transaction fee market.The discussion also addresses the need for a name for smaller units of Bitcoin, with suggestions such as "bit" and "ubit" being made, although some caution against using the former due to cultural connotations in French and Turkish. There is also a proposal for headers-first propagation to limit certain kinds of block-injection/racing attacks and effectively propagate new blocks at the speed of 80 bytes. However, some argue that mining on just a block header would leave small miners disadvantaged, resulting in the same problem as before, where large pools can validate either instantly or more quickly than smaller miners. Another proposal suggests improving block propagation times by distributing partial proofs of work and 'priming' memory pools with transactions.The email thread discussed the incentives of mining and the possible harm to small miners who are disadvantaged due to the time it takes for them to update their UTXO sets. The marginal cost for miners was found to be the increased probability of orphaned blocks due to slower propagation, resulting in increasing returns to higher shares of hashing power. There were concerns about centralization incentives, but it was noted that mining policy is out of the realm of what the protocol can regulate, so miners will do whatever is best for them.The discussion also touched on potential units of account for Bitcoin, with suggestions such as "bit" and "credit." Oliver Egginger suggested that no term for smaller units has been established yet, and Justin A proposed the term "ubit." The importance of culturally neutral terms and avoiding references to cultural elements in naming conventions was emphasized.There were also requests for recent data on specific aspects of blockchain transactions, including the relationship between transaction propagation time and fees/kilobyte, the number of blocks bypassing well-propagated transactions based on fees/kilobyte and total fees, and the signed-double-spend confirmation probability compared to broadcast time offset from the first spend. Jonathan Levin invited suggestions for any other useful statistics that could assist in software development.Throughout the thread, there were links to download a free O'Reilly book on graph databases and information about building an enterprise intranet with eXo Platform software.</p>
