        <h3>Summary:</h3>
        <p>Margherita Favaretto attended "LightningHackdayNYC" where she shared her project on creating a recovering protocol for Lightning Network. Her aim is to solve the issue of false positive nodes in the Eltoo mechanism, which does not cover the case where the other node shares an older transaction that is more favorable for their balance. Margherita's solution involves using other connected nodes as a backup for own recent status. For each transaction between two nodes connected to a third node, A sends an encrypted information about the last commitment transaction with B to C, and for each commitment transaction with C, A sends an encrypted information about the last commitment transaction with C to B.Margherita has created a GitHub project where she welcomes feedback and comments on her draft research. She believes that her idea can solve the current lack in Eltoo and plans to analyze it further. Johan, another member of the community, suggested that Margherita should look into "data loss protection," which is similar to her proposal, as well as watchtowers and static and dynamic channel backups.Margherita invites thoughts and suggestions for proceeding in the wisest way and finding a solution that can also cover all needs. If anyone is interested in this research, she is open to sharing more details about the design of her idea and collaborating to work together.</p>
